# What is MLS?

MLS is a security layer for sending messages in groups of size two to many. It is designed to be
efficient, practical and secure. The MLS specification is in two parts:
  - an [architecture document](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-omara-mls-architecture/)
    setting out the context, problem domain and security requirements, and
  - a [protocol document](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-barnes-mls-protocol/) defining the
    protocol itself.
